# Evaluate a News Article with Natural Language Processing

We will build a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. NLP is the ability of an application to understand the human language, written or oral.

and its main goals are to help learning the following:

- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls


## Run project
The project can be run in both development and production mode.
### run in dev mode
` $ npm run start`

` $ npm run build-dev`

This first command will start the webpack dev server at port 8080 and the second command will start a server at port 3000 
which enables us to do a post to the api.

**Note::** The web page can be accessed witht `localhost:8080`

### run in prod mode
` $ npm run start`

` $ npm run build-prod`
